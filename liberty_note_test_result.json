For durability, I didn't want to lower H too much considering Life Orb Calyrex, so I had to lower B.  It felt like a compromise, but as intended, I was able to take the lead in almost all Zamazenta mirrors, and I was able to win by barely surviving attacks from Black Rider and Miraidon, so the aim was not bad.  The Tera type is Dragon because Zamazenta is the axis against Kyogre, so water resistance is essential, so I considered Grass, Water, and Dragon. Grass is too harsh on Fire consistency, and Water is too harsh on Electric being super effective, so I chose Dragon.",

At first, I was thinking of putting more into D, but Hachima Urshifu became difficult, and Gachiguma's Revenge didn't withstand unless I invested firmly in B, so the durability was almost entirely focused on B.  S was slower than the slowest Morobareru and faster than the iron ball Kyogre, so it was uncorrected reverse V. If you do this, it's best to remove the slowest Pippi.  The reason for Sludge Bomb instead of Pollen Puff is that there are almost no opportunities to ally Pollen Puff in a construction that cannot be cycled, and Sludge Bomb hits Lunaala and Grass Tera that have cut Fairy Tera. It was quite strong.",

I also considered durability distribution so that I could absorb as many attacks as possible, but it was too strong that I was taking over most of Miraidon at the fastest speed, so I didn't adjust the durability.  You can defeat Miraidon with Ghost Tera Astral Bit + Ivy Club.  I considered high-power Wood Hammer for the Water Tera White Rider's hit point. I hardly hit it, but because the usage scene is limited, I made it a hit stable technique.  Thanks to the characteristics and Follow Me, it never rots, and thanks to Ogerpon, I no longer have trouble choosing.",
