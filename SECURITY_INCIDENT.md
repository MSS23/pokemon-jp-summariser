# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED üö®

**Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ACTIVE - Requires immediate user intervention  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPOSED API KEY - ACTION REQUIRED IMMEDIATELY

### üìã **WHAT HAPPENED**
Your Google Gemini API key has been **EXPOSED IN PUBLIC GIT REPOSITORY HISTORY**.

**Compromised API Key**: `AIzaSyDgPxn0MQgcj8M-F1MEcAZExu_9Li-BlKs`

**Location**: The key was committed in file `config/.streamlit/secrets.toml` in git commit `3774281` ("folder clean up")

### üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS - DO THIS NOW**

#### STEP 1: REVOKE THE COMPROMISED KEY (URGENT - Do this first!)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials**
3. Find the API key: `AIzaSyDgPxn0MQgcj8M-F1MEcAZExu_9Li-BlKs`
4. **DELETE/REVOKE** this key immediately
5. **CREATE A NEW API KEY** to replace it

#### STEP 2: UPDATE YOUR LOCAL FILES WITH NEW KEY
After creating the new key, update these files:
- `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- `config/.streamlit/secrets.toml` (if it still exists)

Replace the old key with your new key in both files.

### üîç **SECURITY IMPACT**
- ‚úÖ **Good News**: The application code itself is secure - no hardcoded secrets
- ‚ùå **Bad News**: API key is visible in public git history
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk**: Unauthorized API usage, potential billing charges
- üéØ **Exposure**: Anyone with repository access can see the key

### üõ°Ô∏è **WHAT WE'RE FIXING**
Once you've revoked the old key and created a new one:
1. ‚úÖ Removing the exposed file from git tracking
2. ‚úÖ Cleaning up git history to remove the old key
3. ‚úÖ Enhancing .gitignore to prevent future exposures
4. ‚úÖ Removing duplicate configuration files
5. ‚úÖ Implementing comprehensive secret protection

### üìû **IF YOU NEED HELP**
If you need assistance with:
- Revoking/creating Google Cloud API keys
- Understanding the security impact
- Any part of this remediation process

Please let me know immediately.

### ‚úÖ **CONFIRMATION NEEDED**
Please confirm when you have:
1. ‚úÖ Revoked the old API key in Google Cloud Console
2. ‚úÖ Created a new API key
3. ‚úÖ Updated your local secret files with the new key

Then I can proceed with cleaning up the git repository and implementing additional protections.
