Also, survives a Jolly Chien-Pao (172 Atk) Ice Shard with a 12.5% chance to be one-shot.\n  - Special Attack: 196 EVs (11n)\n  - Special Defense: 4 EVs\n  - Speed: 36 EVs to outspeed max Speed base 90 Pok\u00e9mon.\n  - The author mentions that an ideal spread would be 207 HP, 125 Def, 198 SpA, 136 SpD, and 158 Speed, but they opted for a faster spread to outspeed other Miraidon and Zamazenta. The author prioritizes outspeeding other Miraidon and Zamazenta in the metagame.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 2: Koraidon**\n- Ability: Orichalcum Pulse\n- Held Item: Loaded Dice\n- Tera Type: Fire\n- Nature: Adamant\n- Moves: Scale Shot / Collision Course / Flare Blitz / Protect\n- EV Spread: 4 252 0 0 0 252\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 4 EVs (16n, useful for Grassy Terrain recovery due to Gorillaboom being common)\n  - Attack: 252 EVs (Maximum to increase damage output)\n  - Speed: 252 EVs (Maximum to match speed with Jolly Chien-Pao)\n  - The author mentions that due to the team composition, a sun and Electric Terrain boosted Koraidon is likely to appear, so a fast Dragon move is necessary. Scale Shot was chosen because it can defeat Chien-Pao (4 hits) and Calyrex Shadow Rider (5 hits) even if they have a Focus Sash.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 3: Flutter Mane**\n- Ability: Protosynthesis\n- Held Item: Focus Sash\n- Tera Type: Normal\n- Nature: Timid\n- Moves: Moonblast / Icy Wind / Taunt / Protect\n- EV Spread: 4 0 0 252 0 252\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 4 EVs (Remaining EVs, to increase Flare Blitz recoil damage from opposing Koraidon)\n  - Special Attack: 252 EVs (Maximum to increase damage output)\n  - Speed: 252 EVs (Maximum Speed)\n  - The author uses Normal Tera Type as insurance in case the sun is removed, allowing Flutter Mane to use Icy Wind before Calyrex Shadow Rider. The author does not feel the need for Fairy Tera Type and would rather use the Tera on other Pok\u00e9mon. Taunt is used to stop Trick Room from Lunala and Ursaluna.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 4: Volcarona**\n- Ability: Flame Body\n- Held Item: Electric Seed\n- Tera Type: Water\n- Nature: Bold\n- Moves: Fiery Dance / Rage Powder / Tailwind / Protect\n- EV Spread: 252 0 204 0 52 0\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 252 EVs (Maximum HP)\n  - Defense: 204 EVs (16n+1, even number for Electric Seed efficiency. Survives Adamant Chien-Pao's (189 Atk) Crunch approximately twice with a 3.5% chance to be 2HKO'd after Electric Seed boost)\n  - Special Defense: 52 EVs (Survives Timid Calyrex Shadow Rider's (217 SpA) double target Astral Barrage approximately twice with an 8.5% chance to be 2HKO'd)\n  - The author uses Water Tera Type to resist moves from Kyogre, Calyrex Ice Rider, and Zacian. The goal is to survive in front of Koraidon and Amoonguss to set up Tailwind. The EV spread was initially 252 Defense, but some EVs were moved to Special Defense to set up Tailwind in front of Calyrex Shadow Rider. The author uses Volcarona to absorb moves from Chien-Pao, Zamazenta, and Zacian, and to stall Trick Room turns in front of Calyrex Ice Rider and Iron Hands.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 5: Grimmsnarl**\n- Ability: Prankster\n- Held Item: Covert Cloak\n- Tera Type: Ground\n- Nature: Impish\n- Moves: Sucker Punch / Thunder Wave / Light Screen / Fake Out\n- EV Spread: 252 0 156 0 100 0\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 252 EVs (Maximum HP)\n  - Defense: 156 EVs (Guaranteed to survive Zamazenta's (141 Atk, 4 EVs) Heavy Slam)\n  - Special Defense: 100 EVs (Remaining EVs)\n  - The author considers Grimmsnarl to be the strongest Pok\u00e9mon due to its versatility. Sucker Punch is used to chip Focus Sashes, especially on Calyrex Shadow Rider, and also hits Endeavor Whimsicott. Thunder Wave is used for speed control. Light Screen is used against special attackers. Fake Out is used to counter opposing Fake Out and disrupt the opponent. The Covert Cloak prevents Fake Out from being redirected. The author states that the Tera Type is not important and has not been used.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 6: Incineroar**\n- Ability: Intimidate\n- Held Item: Assault Vest\n- Tera Type: Water\n- Nature: Adamant\n- Moves: Flare Blitz / Knock Off / U-Turn / Fake Out\n- EV Spread: 244 36 124 0 76 28\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 244 EVs (Slightly more HP. The author wanted 252 HP but could not without sacrificing other stats. Reducing Special Defense by 8 would change the damage from Electro Drift by 3, so they settled on 244 HP)\n  - Attack: 36 EVs (11n)\n  - Defense: 124 EVs (Guaranteed to survive Calyrex Ice Rider's (220 Atk) double target Glacial Lance and 100,000 Horsepower)\n  - Special Defense: 76 EVs (Even number for maximum efficiency. Guaranteed to survive Modest Miraidon's (205 SpA) Electro Drift with some leeway)\n  - Speed: 28 EVs (Slightly faster than other Incineroar, -1 Speed compared to slowest Kyogre (important), and outspeeds max Speed base 100 Pok\u00e9mon (Chi-Yu, etc.) under Tailwind)\n  - The author considers Incineroar to be the most versatile Pok\u00e9mon in the current metagame due to its bulk and strength. The Assault Vest provides the necessary bulk to survive Miraidon's Electro Drift. The EVs allocated to Attack increase the damage output of Flare Blitz.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThe team focuses on taking a lead with Miraidon and Incineroar, using their combined power to gain an advantage in numbers. Electric Terrain and sun are easily overwritten, so the team aims to quickly reduce the opponent's Pok\u00e9mon to gain a cycling advantage.\n\n**FINAL ARTICLE SUMMARY:**\nThe article details a Pok\u00e9mon VGC team that achieved a final ranking of 11th place with a rating of 2001. The team was built around Grimmsnarl, which the author considers to be the strongest Pok\u00e9mon in the format due to its versatility. The team aims to gain an advantage by taking out opponents quickly with strong individual Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n- **TEAM STRENGTHS**:\n  - The team is built around the versatility of Grimmsnarl and Incineroar.\n  - The team focuses on gaining an advantage in numbers by quickly taking out opponents with strong individual Pok\u00e9mon.\n  - The team has good matchups against Calyrex Shadow Rider, Kyogre, Calyrex Ice Rider, and Zacian.\n- **TEAM WEAKNESSES**:\n  - The team struggles against Ursaluna due to Trick Room.\n  - The team struggles against Ho-Oh and Iron Treads.\n  - The team struggles against Groudon.\n\nThe team's strategy revolves around using Miraidon's Electro Drift to quickly take out opponents and then using Koraidon to finish off the remaining Pok\u00e9mon. The author emphasizes the importance of speed control and using Thunder Wave to slow down opponents. The author also notes the importance of predicting the opponent's moves and using Volt Switch to cycle Pok\u00e9mon. The author also provides specific strategies for dealing with common threats such as Calyrex Shadow Rider, Kyogre, Calyrex Ice Rider, and Zacian. The author also notes that the team struggles against Ursaluna due to Trick Room, and Ho-Oh and Iron Treads. The author also provides a rental code for the team.\nThe author also mentions that they used a different item on Volcarona (Electric Seed and Sitrus Berry) during the JCS 2025 online qualifiers, but did not qualify.\nThe author emphasizes the importance of not overlooking the order in which abilities activate. They also stress the importance of speed matchups against Miraidon and Zamazenta. They advise playing as if Scale Shot will always hit, rather than being afraid of missing. They also advise against leading with Koraidon, as it can lead to a guessing game. They also advise against using Fake Out on Kyogre due to the prevalence of Tera and Covert Cloak. They also advise against using Electro Drift on Kyogre on the first turn, and instead using Volt Switch. They advise that it is okay to use Fake Out on Whimsicott, as Dazzling Gleam can take advantage of Focus Sash or Covert Cloak. They advise using Miraidon to deal with Fire Tera Calyrex Ice Rider. They advise keeping Lunala's Meteor Beam and Calyrex Shadow Rider's Encore in mind. They advise always bringing Volcarona against Zamazenta and Calyrex Ice Rider other than Calyrex Shadow Rider/Zamazenta.\nThe author prioritizes dealing with Iron Treads when facing Ho-Oh and Iron Treads. They often use Tera with Miraidon to chip down Groudon. They describe the matchup against Flutter Mane and Koraidon as a \"coin flip\".", "pokemon": []}, "https://liberty-note.com/2024/12/05/sv-double-s24-19th/": {"summary": "**TITLE: S24 Double Final 19th Place World's Easiest Choice Band Rock Slide Sushi**\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 1: Frosmoth**\n- Ability: Ice Scales\n- Held Item: Leftovers\n- Tera Type: Water\n- Nature: Bold\n- Moves: Blizzard / Wide Guard / Quiver Dance / Tera Blast\n- EV Spread: 252 0 236 4 4 12\n- EV Explanation: HP is set to 16n+1. Defense is set to 11n. This Pok\u00e9mon is the main attacker of the team. The HP and Defense EVs are invested to provide some physical bulk, while Quiver Dance is used to raise Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Leftovers was chosen over Sitrus Berry because Frosmoth tends to stay on the field for a long time due to its special bulk. Blizzard was chosen as the Ice-type move because it is a high-power spread move, despite its low accuracy. Wide Guard is used to support the team. The Tera Type is Water because it has good offensive and defensive synergy and is effective against rain teams.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 2: Volcarona**\n- Ability: Flame Body\n- Held Item: Rocky Helmet\n- Tera Type: Steel\n- Nature: Bold\n- Moves: Heat Wave / Will-O-Wisp / Rage Powder / Struggle Bug\n- EV Spread: 252 0 236 4 4 12\n- EV Explanation: HP is set to 16n. This Volcarona is a support role. The EVs are invested to maximise physical bulk. Flame Body and Rocky Helmet are used to inflict burns and damage. Struggle Bug is used to support against special attackers. The Tera Type is Steel because the team struggles against Rock-type attacks, and Steel has many resistances.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 3: Alolan Ninetales**\n- Ability: Snow Warning\n- Held Item: Life Orb\n- Tera Type: Ghost\n- Nature: Timid\n- Moves: Freeze-Dry / Aurora Veil / Icy Wind / Moonblast\n- EV Spread: 4 0 20 252 4 228\n- EV Explanation: HP is set to 10n-1. Speed is set to outspeed base 105s. This Pok\u00e9mon is a weather setter and fast attacker. Icy Wind is used for speed control, and Moonblast is used to deal Fairy-type damage, which is lacking in Regulation H. Freeze-Dry was chosen for its coverage. Life Orb was chosen for the extra damage output, even though the recoil damage can be a drawback. The Tera Type is Ghost because it resists Poison-type attacks and is immune to Fake Out.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 4: Garchomp**\n- Ability: Rough Skin\n- Held Item: Clear Amulet\n- Tera Type: Fire\n- Nature: Jolly\n- Moves: Earthquake / Protect / Rock Slide / Wide Breaker\n- EV Spread: 0 252 0 0 4 252\n- EV Explanation: Speed is maximised to outspeed other Garchomp. This Pok\u00e9mon complements Frosmoth's type matchups. It is useful against physical attackers that Frosmoth struggles with, using Wide Breaker to lower their Attack and Rough Skin to chip away at their HP. The Tera Type is Fire because it is strong against Incineroar and Rillaboom and prevents burns.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 5: Incineroar**\n- Ability: Intimidate\n- Held Item: Sitrus Berry\n- Tera Type: Ghost\n- Nature: Careful\n- Moves: Flare Blitz / Parting Shot / Fake Out / Knock Off\n- EV Spread: 252 4 0 0 252 0\n- EV Explanation: The EVs are invested to maximise HP and Special Defense. This Pok\u00e9mon provides support with Intimidate and Fake Out and helps to overcome difficult matchups. Knock Off is a strong move that can remove important items from opponents.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 6: Rillaboom**\n- Ability: Grassy Surge\n- Held Item: Assault Vest\n- Tera Type: Fire\n- Nature: Adamant\n- Moves: Grassy Glide / Wood Hammer / High Horsepower / Fake Out\n- EV Spread: 252 252 0 0 0 4\n- EV Explanation: This Pok\u00e9mon provides healing with Grassy Terrain and support with Fake Out. It is effective against Water-types and physical attackers that Frosmoth struggles with, especially in sand teams. Grassy Glide and Wood Hammer are strong moves in Grassy Terrain.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThis team is built around Frosmoth and uses Alolan Ninetales to set up snow and support it. The other team members provide type coverage, support, and utility. The team aims to control the board and win in the mid-to-late game.\n\n**FINAL ARTICLE SUMMARY:**\nThe article is a team report for a VGC Regulation H team that achieved a top 19th finish in Season 24. The team is built around Frosmoth, with Alolan Ninetales providing snow support. The team includes Volcarona, Garchomp, Incineroar, and Rillaboom to provide type coverage, support, and utility.\n\n- **Overall team strategy and concept**: The team's strategy is to control the board and win in the mid-to-late game by using Frosmoth as the main attacker, supported by Alolan Ninetales' snow and other team members' utility.\n- **Key Pokemon roles and synergies**: Frosmoth is the main attacker, Alolan Ninetales provides snow support, Volcarona provides support with Rage Powder and burns, Garchomp provides type coverage and physical attack support, Incineroar provides Intimidate and Fake Out support, and Rillaboom provides healing with Grassy Terrain and Fake Out support.\n- **TEAM STRENGTHS**:\n  - The team is strong against rain teams due to Frosmoth's Water Tera Type.\n  - Rillaboom is advantageous against sand teams and Water-types.\n- **TEAM WEAKNESSES**:\n  - The team struggles against Annihilape and Kingambit due to their high damage output and abilities.\n  - The team struggles against \"sushi\" teams (likely referring to teams with Tatsugiri and Dondozo) due to the lack of Haze or Clear Smog.\n  - The team struggles against Ursaluna due to its Unnerve ability and strong attacks in Trick Room.\n- **AUTHOR'S ASSESSMENT**: The author acknowledges that the team relies on outplaying opponents and capitalizing on favorable matchups.\n- **Meta positioning and tournament viability**: The team is viable in the current meta, but it has some weaknesses that need to be addressed.\n- **Any unique strategies or innovations mentioned**: The team uses a Frosmoth as the main attacker, which is not a common strategy.\n- **Author's recommendations and insights**: The author recommends adjusting the team to address its weaknesses against Annihilape, Kingambit, \"sushi\" teams, and Ursaluna.\n- **Team's competitive advantages and potential counters**: The team's competitive advantages include its strong offense and good type coverage. Potential counters include Annihilape, Kingambit, \"sushi\" teams, and Ursaluna.\n- **Lead combinations and selection strategies**: The author does not have a fixed lead combination but chooses the lead based on the opponent's team composition.\n- **Specific matchups and counter strategies**: The author provides specific strategies for dealing with rain teams, sun teams, Trick Room teams, and sand teams.\n- **EV spread reasoning and benchmarks**: The EV spreads are designed to maximize the Pok\u00e9mon's strengths and minimize their weaknesses.\n- **Item and ability choices explanation**: The item and ability choices are designed to complement the Pok\u00e9mon's role on the team.\n- **Move selection rationale**: The move selection is designed to provide the Pok\u00e9mon with the best possible coverage and utility.\n- **Team building process and changes made**: The team was built around Frosmoth, and the other team members were chosen to provide type coverage, support, and utility. The author initially used a Lanturn instead of Incineroar but switched back to Incineroar because Lanturn's Electric-type attacks were not as effective as expected.", "pokemon": []}, "https://liberty-note.com/2025/07/31/teru-fes-viera-1st/": {"summary": "**TITLE: Yu's Victory Team: Calyrex Shadow and Zamazenta**\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 1: Calyrex Shadow Rider**\n- Ability: As One (Spectrier)\n- Held Item: Focus Sash\n- Tera Type: Ghost\n- Nature: Timid\n- Moves: Astral Barrage / Psychic / Encore / Protect\n- EV Spread: 0 4 0 252 0 252\n- EV Explanation: Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment. The author tried a build with more Defense to survive Urshifu's Surging Strikes, but found that reducing Special Attack made it difficult to secure certain KOs. Encore is used to punish Protect and Fake Out. Tera Type Ghost is used to increase the power of Astral Barrage.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 2: Zamazenta**\n- Ability: Dauntless Shield\n- Held Item: Rusted Shield\n- Tera Type: Dragon\n- Nature: Impish\n- Moves: Body Press / Heavy Slam / Wide Guard / Protect\n- EV Spread: 220 0 156 0 0 132\n- EV Explanation: Speed is invested to outspeed Adamant Urshifu-Rapid-Strike by 2 points. The remaining EVs are split between HP and Defense. The author wanted to avoid lowering HP too much due to Life Orb Calyrex Shadow Rider, so they lowered Defense instead. Tera Type Dragon was chosen to resist Water against Kyogre, as Zamazenta is the main counter. The author considered Grass and Water Tera Types, but Grass had a weakness to Fire and Water had a weakness to Electric.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 3: Chien-Pao**\n- Ability: Sword of Ruin\n- Held Item: Assault Vest\n- Tera Type: Poison\n- Nature: Jolly\n- Moves: Ice Spinner / Ruination / Sucker Punch / Ice Shard\n- EV Spread: 252 4 36 0 84 132\n- EV Explanation: Speed is invested to outspeed base 135 Speed Pokemon with a neutral nature. The remaining EVs are invested in HP and Special Defense to survive Urshifu's Surging Strikes. Tera Type Poison was chosen to resist Fighting and Fairy, but the author suggests that Tera Type Ground could be interesting against Miraidon.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 4: Chi-Yu**\n- Ability: Beads of Ruin\n- Held Item: Choice Scarf\n- Tera Type: Ghost\n- Nature: Modest\n- Moves: Heat Wave / Flamethrower / Overheat / Dark Pulse\n- EV Spread: 4 0 0 252 0 252\n- EV Explanation: Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment. Tera Type Ghost is used to avoid Fake Out.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 5: Amoonguss**\n- Ability: Regenerator\n- Held Item: Rocky Helmet\n- Tera Type: Water\n- Nature: Bold\n- Moves: Sludge Bomb / Spore / Rage Powder / Protect\n- EV Spread: 236 0 236 0 36 0\n- EV Explanation: HP is set to be a multiple of 3. Defense is set to be 11n. The author initially considered investing more in Special Defense, but shifted the investment to Defense to better handle Choice Band Urshifu and Guts Ursaluna's Facade. Speed is set to be slower than minimum Speed Amoonguss and faster than Iron Ball Kyogre. The author suggests that outspeeding minimum speed Pipi would be optimal. Sludge Bomb was chosen over Pollen Puff because the team cannot cycle and there are few opportunities to heal allies with Pollen Puff. Sludge Bomb is also effective against Fairy Tera Lunala and Grass Tera Pokemon.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 6: Ogerpon (Rock)**\n- Ability: Sturdy\n- Held Item: Cornerstone Mask\n- Tera Type: Rock\n- Nature: Jolly\n- Moves: Ivy Cudgel / Wood Hammer / Follow Me / Spiky Shield\n- EV Spread: 0 252 4 0 0 252\n- EV Explanation: Maximum Attack and Speed investment. The author considered investing in bulk to absorb more attacks, but the ability to outspeed most Miraidon was too valuable. Tera Type Rock Ivy Cudgel can OHKO Miraidon. Wood Hammer was chosen for its high power against Water Tera Calyrex Ice Rider, despite its low accuracy. The combination of Sturdy and Follow Me makes Ogerpon a valuable support Pokemon.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThis team is built around Calyrex Shadow Rider and Zamazenta, with Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, Amoonguss, and Ogerpon providing support and coverage. The team aims to support Calyrex Shadow Rider with redirection and disruption, while Zamazenta provides a strong defensive backbone. Chien-Pao offers offensive pressure and priority, while Chi-Yu provides additional special attack power. Amoonguss provides spore support and redirection, and Ogerpon offers redirection and a strong grass-type attack.\n\n**FINAL ARTICLE SUMMARY:**\nThe article details the team used by Yu to win the Teru Fes Viera Cup. The team is built around Calyrex Shadow Rider and Zamazenta, with a focus on supporting Calyrex Shadow Rider and providing strong offensive and defensive coverage.\n\n- **Overall team strategy and concept**: The team aims to support Calyrex Shadow Rider with redirection and disruption, while Zamazenta provides a strong defensive backbone.\n- **Key Pokemon roles and synergies**: Calyrex Shadow Rider is the main offensive threat, Zamazenta provides defense and Wide Guard support, Chien-Pao offers offensive pressure and priority, Chi-Yu provides special attack power, Amoonguss provides spore support and redirection, and Ogerpon offers redirection and a strong grass-type attack.\n- **TEAM STRENGTHS**: The author states that the team has high adaptability.\n- **TEAM WEAKNESSES**: Not specified in the article or image.\n- **AUTHOR'S ASSESSMENT**: The author believes the team is well-rounded and can be customized for the CTS format.\n- **Meta positioning and tournament viability**: The author believes the team is well-positioned in the current meta and can be successful in tournaments.\n- **Any unique strategies or innovations mentioned**: The use of Assault Vest Chien-Pao is a notable innovation.\n- **Author's recommendations and insights**: The author recommends considering Tera Type Ground on Chien-Pao for the OTS format.\n- **Team's competitive advantages and potential counters**: The team has good matchups against Miraidon and Calyrex Shadow Rider, but struggles against sun teams.\n- **Lead combinations and selection strategies**: The author provides specific lead combinations for different matchups.\n- **Specific matchups and counter strategies**: The author provides specific strategies for dealing with Miraidon, Calyrex Ice Rider, Calyrex Shadow Rider, and sun teams.\n- **EV spread reasoning and benchmarks**: The author provides detailed explanations for the EV spreads on each Pokemon.\n- **Item and ability choices explanation**: The author explains the reasoning behind the item and ability choices on each Pokemon.\n- **Move selection rationale**: The author explains the reasoning behind the move selections on each Pokemon.\n- **Team building process and changes made**: The author initially tried a Life Orb Calyrex Shadow Rider with a Smeargle, but found it too inconsistent.
