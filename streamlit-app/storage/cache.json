Also, survives a Jolly Chien-Pao (172 Atk) Ice Shard with a 12.5% chance to be one-shot.\n  - Special Attack: 196 EVs (11n)\n  - Special Defense: 4 EVs\n  - Speed: 36 EVs to outspeed max Speed base 90 Pok\u00e9mon.\n  - The author mentions that an ideal spread would be 207 HP, 125 Def, 198 SpA, 136 SpD, and 158 Speed, but they opted for a faster spread to outspeed other Miraidon and Zamazenta. The author prioritizes outspeeding other Miraidon and Zamazenta in the metagame.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 2: Koraidon**\n- Ability: Orichalcum Pulse\n- Held Item: Loaded Dice\n- Tera Type: Fire\n- Nature: Adamant\n- Moves: Scale Shot / Collision Course / Flare Blitz / Protect\n- EV Spread: 4 252 0 0 0 252\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 4 EVs (16n, useful for Grassy Terrain recovery due to Gorillaboom being common)\n  - Attack: 252 EVs (Maximum to increase damage output)\n  - Speed: 252 EVs (Maximum to match speed with Jolly Chien-Pao)\n  - The author mentions that due to the team composition, a sun and Electric Terrain boosted Koraidon is likely to appear, so a fast Dragon move is necessary. Scale Shot was chosen because it can defeat Chien-Pao (4 hits) and Calyrex Shadow Rider (5 hits) even if they have a Focus Sash.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 3: Flutter Mane**\n- Ability: Protosynthesis\n- Held Item: Focus Sash\n- Tera Type: Normal\n- Nature: Timid\n- Moves: Moonblast / Icy Wind / Taunt / Protect\n- EV Spread: 4 0 0 252 0 252\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 4 EVs (Remaining EVs, to increase Flare Blitz recoil damage from opposing Koraidon)\n  - Special Attack: 252 EVs (Maximum to increase damage output)\n  - Speed: 252 EVs (Maximum Speed)\n  - The author uses Normal Tera Type as insurance in case the sun is removed, allowing Flutter Mane to use Icy Wind before Calyrex Shadow Rider. The author does not feel the need for Fairy Tera Type and would rather use the Tera on other Pok\u00e9mon. Taunt is used to stop Trick Room from Lunala and Ursaluna.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 4: Volcarona**\n- Ability: Flame Body\n- Held Item: Electric Seed\n- Tera Type: Water\n- Nature: Bold\n- Moves: Fiery Dance / Rage Powder / Tailwind / Protect\n- EV Spread: 252 0 204 0 52 0\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 252 EVs (Maximum HP)\n  - Defense: 204 EVs (16n+1, even number for Electric Seed efficiency. Survives Adamant Chien-Pao's (189 Atk) Crunch approximately twice with a 3.5% chance to be 2HKO'd after Electric Seed boost)\n  - Special Defense: 52 EVs (Survives Timid Calyrex Shadow Rider's (217 SpA) double target Astral Barrage approximately twice with an 8.5% chance to be 2HKO'd)\n  - The author uses Water Tera Type to resist moves from Kyogre, Calyrex Ice Rider, and Zacian. The goal is to survive in front of Koraidon and Amoonguss to set up Tailwind. The EV spread was initially 252 Defense, but some EVs were moved to Special Defense to set up Tailwind in front of Calyrex Shadow Rider. The author uses Volcarona to absorb moves from Chien-Pao, Zamazenta, and Zacian, and to stall Trick Room turns in front of Calyrex Ice Rider and Iron Hands.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 5: Grimmsnarl**\n- Ability: Prankster\n- Held Item: Covert Cloak\n- Tera Type: Ground\n- Nature: Impish\n- Moves: Sucker Punch / Thunder Wave / Light Screen / Fake Out\n- EV Spread: 252 0 156 0 100 0\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 252 EVs (Maximum HP)\n  - Defense: 156 EVs (Guaranteed to survive Zamazenta's (141 Atk, 4 EVs) Heavy Slam)\n  - Special Defense: 100 EVs (Remaining EVs)\n  - The author considers Grimmsnarl to be the strongest Pok\u00e9mon due to its versatility. Sucker Punch is used to chip Focus Sashes, especially on Calyrex Shadow Rider, and also hits Endeavor Whimsicott. Thunder Wave is used for speed control. Light Screen is used against special attackers. Fake Out is used to counter opposing Fake Out and disrupt the opponent. The Covert Cloak prevents Fake Out from being redirected. The author states that the Tera Type is not important and has not been used.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 6: Incineroar**\n- Ability: Intimidate\n- Held Item: Assault Vest\n- Tera Type: Water\n- Nature: Adamant\n- Moves: Flare Blitz / Knock Off / U-Turn / Fake Out\n- EV Spread: 244 36 124 0 76 28\n- EV Explanation:\n  - HP: 244 EVs (Slightly more HP. The author wanted 252 HP but could not without sacrificing other stats. Reducing Special Defense by 8 would change the damage from Electro Drift by 3, so they settled on 244 HP)\n  - Attack: 36 EVs (11n)\n  - Defense: 124 EVs (Guaranteed to survive Calyrex Ice Rider's (220 Atk) double target Glacial Lance and 100,000 Horsepower)\n  - Special Defense: 76 EVs (Even number for maximum efficiency. Guaranteed to survive Modest Miraidon's (205 SpA) Electro Drift with some leeway)\n  - Speed: 28 EVs (Slightly faster than other Incineroar, -1 Speed compared to slowest Kyogre (important), and outspeeds max Speed base 100 Pok\u00e9mon (Chi-Yu, etc.) under Tailwind)\n  - The author considers Incineroar to be the most versatile Pok\u00e9mon in the current metagame due to its bulk and strength. The Assault Vest provides the necessary bulk to survive Miraidon's Electro Drift. The EVs allocated to Attack increase the damage output of Flare Blitz.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThe team focuses on taking a lead with Miraidon and Incineroar, using their combined power to gain an advantage in numbers. Electric Terrain and sun are easily overwritten, so the team aims to quickly reduce the opponent's Pok\u00e9mon to gain a cycling advantage.\n\n**FINAL ARTICLE SUMMARY:**\nThe article details a Pok\u00e9mon VGC team that achieved a final ranking of 11th place with a rating of 2001. The team was built around Grimmsnarl, which the author considers to be the strongest Pok\u00e9mon in the format due to its versatility. The team aims to gain an advantage by taking out opponents quickly with strong individual Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n- **TEAM STRENGTHS**:\n  - The team is built around the versatility of Grimmsnarl and Incineroar.\n  - The team focuses on gaining an advantage in numbers by quickly taking out opponents with strong individual Pok\u00e9mon.\n  - The team has good matchups against Calyrex Shadow Rider, Kyogre, Calyrex Ice Rider, and Zacian.\n- **TEAM WEAKNESSES**:\n  - The team struggles against Ursaluna due to Trick Room.\n  - The team struggles against Ho-Oh and Iron Treads.\n  - The team struggles against Groudon.\n\nThe team's strategy revolves around using Miraidon's Electro Drift to quickly take out opponents and then using Koraidon to finish off the remaining Pok\u00e9mon. The author emphasizes the importance of speed control and using Thunder Wave to slow down opponents. The author also notes the importance of predicting the opponent's moves and using Volt Switch to cycle Pok\u00e9mon. The author also provides specific strategies for dealing with common threats such as Calyrex Shadow Rider, Kyogre, Calyrex Ice Rider, and Zacian. The author also notes that the team struggles against Ursaluna due to Trick Room, and Ho-Oh and Iron Treads. The author also provides a rental code for the team.\nThe author also mentions that they used a different item on Volcarona (Electric Seed and Sitrus Berry) during the JCS 2025 online qualifiers, but did not qualify.\nThe author emphasizes the importance of not overlooking the order in which abilities activate. They also stress the importance of speed matchups against Miraidon and Zamazenta. They advise playing as if Scale Shot will always hit, rather than being afraid of missing. They also advise against leading with Koraidon, as it can lead to a guessing game. They also advise against using Fake Out on Kyogre due to the prevalence of Tera and Covert Cloak. They also advise against using Electro Drift on Kyogre on the first turn, and instead using Volt Switch. They advise that it is okay to use Fake Out on Whimsicott, as Dazzling Gleam can take advantage of Focus Sash or Covert Cloak. They advise using Miraidon to deal with Fire Tera Calyrex Ice Rider. They advise keeping Lunala's Meteor Beam and Calyrex Shadow Rider's Encore in mind. They advise always bringing Volcarona against Zamazenta and Calyrex Ice Rider other than Calyrex Shadow Rider/Zamazenta.\nThe author prioritizes dealing with Iron Treads when facing Ho-Oh and Iron Treads. They often use Tera with Miraidon to chip down Groudon. They describe the matchup against Flutter Mane and Koraidon as a \"coin flip\".", "pokemon": []}, "https://liberty-note.com/2024/12/05/sv-double-s24-19th/": {"summary": "**TITLE: S24 Double Final 19th Place World's Easiest Choice Band Rock Slide Sushi**\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 1: Frosmoth**\n- Ability: Ice Scales\n- Held Item: Leftovers\n- Tera Type: Water\n- Nature: Bold\n- Moves: Blizzard / Wide Guard / Quiver Dance / Tera Blast\n- EV Spread: 252 0 236 4 4 12\n- EV Explanation: HP is set to 16n+1. Defense is set to 11n. This Pok\u00e9mon is the main attacker of the team. The HP and Defense EVs are invested to provide some physical bulk, while Quiver Dance is used to raise Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Leftovers was chosen over Sitrus Berry because Frosmoth tends to stay on the field for a long time due to its special bulk. Blizzard was chosen as the Ice-type move because it is a high-power spread move, despite its low accuracy. Wide Guard is used to support the team. The Tera Type is Water because it has good offensive and defensive synergy and is effective against rain teams.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 2: Volcarona**\n- Ability: Flame Body\n- Held Item: Rocky Helmet\n- Tera Type: Steel\n- Nature: Bold\n- Moves: Heat Wave / Will-O-Wisp / Rage Powder / Struggle Bug\n- EV Spread: 252 0 236 4 4 12\n- EV Explanation: HP is set to 16n.

Speed is set to outspeed base 105s. This Pok\u00e9mon is a weather setter and fast attacker. Icy Wind is used for speed control, and Moonblast is used to deal Fairy-type damage, which is lacking in Regulation H. Freeze-Dry was chosen for its coverage. Life Orb was chosen for the extra damage output, even though the recoil damage can be a drawback. The Tera Type is Ghost because it resists Poison-type attacks and is immune to Fake Out.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 4: Garchomp**\n- Ability: Rough Skin\n- Held Item: Clear Amulet\n- Tera Type: Fire\n- Nature: Jolly\n- Moves: Earthquake / Protect / Rock Slide / Wide Breaker\n- EV Spread: 0 252 0 0 4 252\n- EV Explanation: Speed is maximised to outspeed other Garchomp. This Pok\u00e9mon complements Frosmoth's type matchups. It is useful against physical attackers that Frosmoth struggles with, using Wide Breaker to lower their Attack and Rough Skin to chip away at their HP. The Tera Type is Fire because it is strong against Incineroar and Rillaboom and prevents burns.\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon 5: Incineroar**\n- Ability: Intimidate\n- Held Item: Sitrus Berry\n- Tera Type: Ghost\n- Nature: Careful\n- Moves: Flare Blitz / Parting Shot / Fake Out / Knock Off\n- EV Spread: 252 4 0 0 252 0\n- EV Explanation: The EVs are invested to maximise HP and Special Defense.

It is effective against Water-types and physical attackers that Frosmoth struggles with, especially in sand teams. Grassy Glide and Wood Hammer are strong moves in Grassy Terrain.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThis team is built around Frosmoth and uses Alolan Ninetales to set up snow and support it. The other team members provide type coverage, support, and utility. The team aims to control the board and win in the mid-to-late game.\n\n**FINAL ARTICLE SUMMARY:**\nThe article is a team report for a VGC Regulation H team that achieved a top 19th finish in Season 24.
