The team aims to control the pace of the game and set up Calyrex Shadow Rider to sweep in the late game. The author made some changes to the team from the previous month, replacing Scarf Chi-Yu and Urshifu Rapid Strike with Choice Band Dragonite and Booster Energy Iron Valiant.\n\n**FINAL ARTICLE SUMMARY:**\nThe article discusses the author's team used in Season 32 of Pok\u00e9mon VGC, which achieved a final rank of 14th. The team is a variation of a previous team, with some key changes made to address weaknesses and improve matchups against certain archetypes. The core of the team is Calyrex Shadow Rider and Zamazenta, with the other four Pok\u00e9mon providing support and coverage.\n\nThe author replaced Scarf Chi-Yu with Choice Band Dragonite to counter opposing teams with screens, Volcarona, and Miraidon. Dragonite's Extreme Speed allows it to bypass screens and deal significant damage. The author also replaced Urshifu Rapid Strike with Booster Energy Iron Valiant to handle Calyrex Shadow Rider and Zamazenta mirror matches. Iron Valiant's moveset includes Aura Sphere for Zamazenta, Dazzling Gleam for Calyrex Shadow Rider, and Thunder Wave to disrupt opponents.\n\nThe author outlines several common lead combinations and strategies. One strategy involves leading with Zamazenta and Chien-Pao, then bringing in Calyrex Shadow Rider and Amoonguss or Iron Valiant in the back. Another strategy involves leading with Chien-Pao and Dragonite against teams with screens, Volcarona, or Miraidon.\n\n**TEAM STRENGTHS:**\n- Dragonite is very effective against teams that struggle to deal with Dragon-types, particularly after Flutter Mane has been weakened.\n- Dragonite and Chien-Pao can break through screens set up by Pok\u00e9mon like Grimmsnarl.\n- Dragonite is a good partner for Calyrex Shadow Rider and Zamazenta.\n\n**TEAM WEAKNESSES:**\n- Iron Valiant feels underpowered in matchups other than Calyrex Shadow Rider/Zamazenta mirrors and against Terapagos.\n- The author feels that they could have played Iron Valiant better in some matches.\n- The author feels that reducing the Defense and Special Defense investment on Zamazenta was a mistake, and that they should have invested more in Speed to win Zamazenta mirror matches.\n- Reducing the Defense investment on Zamazenta made it less reliable at dealing with Water Urshifu.\n\nThe author expresses some disappointment with their final ranking, as they had hoped to achieve first place. They also express concern about the upcoming Regulation J ruleset.", "pokemon": []}}
